CoreferenceResolution in biomedical full text
=====================
This thesis I started on March 2014 and defended on the 27th November 2014. The goal of the thesis was to build a system that deals with protein coreference resolution in full text. 
My thesis' advisor was Juan Miguel Cejuela and my supervisor Prof. Burkhard Rost. With their support I finished successfully this project and I outperform the current state of the art in Protein coreference resolution.
