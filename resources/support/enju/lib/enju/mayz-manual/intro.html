<h1>What is MAYZ toolkit?</h1>

<a href="intro.ja.html">Japanese version</a>

<p>
The MAYZ Toolkit provides tools to support the corpus-oriented
development of lexicalized grammars.  Corpus-oriented development is a
new methodology of developing wide-coverage lexicalized grammars.  In
conventional grammar development, grammar writers build a large
lexicon manually, while in our method we first make a <em>derivation
bank</em> (derivbank).  A derivbank is a treebank of a target grammar
theory, e.g., HPSG treebank.  It includes real sentences annotated
with its syntactic structure.  Annotations must conform to grammar
rules (principles and schemas) assessed by the grammar theory.  When
derivation structures are properly assigned to real sentences, a
lexicon is extract from them.

<p>
The MAYZ Toolkit helps the development of a derivbank, and extracts a
lexicon from the derivbank.  Users can make a large lexicalized
grammar only by writing grammar rules (schemas) and heuristic rules
for annotation.  In addition, it provides tools to make disambiguation
models based on maximum entropy models.  You can make probabilistic
disambiguation models only by writing pattern rules of extracting
features of maximum entropy models.

<p>
The package also includes a general-purpose parser (Unification
Parser, UP).  This parser supports beam thresholding using
probabilistic models.  Users can readily apply grammars developed by
MAYZ to real tasks.
