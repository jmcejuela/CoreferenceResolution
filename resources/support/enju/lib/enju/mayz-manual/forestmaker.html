<h1>forestmaker: Tool for making feature forest model</h1>

<a href="forestmaker.ja.html">Japanese version</a>

<p>
This is a tool for making event files of feature forest models.

<p>
<table border=1>
<tr><td colspan=2>forestmaker model_name grammar_module derivbank event_file
<tr><td>model_name<td>name of a probabilistic model (this will be used
in parsing)
<tr><td>grammar_module<td>lilfes program in which a grammar and
predicates for event extraction are implemented
<tr><td>derivbank<td>derivbank obtained by "lexextract" (lildb format)
<tr><td>event_file<td>file to output unfiltered events
(text format or compressed (gz or bz) format)
<tr><td colspan=2>Options
<tr><td>-r file_name<td>file to output reference distribution 
<tr><td>-n threshold<td>limit number of events to be output
<tr><td>-v<td>print debug messages
<tr><td>-vv<td>print many debug messages
</table>

<p>
The name of a probabilistic model must be assigned to each event
file.  This means that by assigning different names, you can use
multiple models in parsing.  For example, if you incorporate a unigram
model as a reference distribution into a feature forest model, you
must assign different names to the models.

<p>
This tool supports the construction of a maximum entropy model of a
derivation, given a grammar and a derivbank.  This tool makes
unfiltered events that will be required for the estimation of a
probabilistic model.

<p>
An unfiltered event is a string that has several fields separated by
"//".  An example is as follows.

<blockquote>
<pre>
SUBJ//plays//VBZ//[npVPnp]//haag//NNP//[NP]_2//binary
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
The last field ("binary") denotes the <em>category</em> of this event.
A category will be used in the later steps, such as for applying masks
to the events.  Events that have the same category name must have the
same number of fieds, since the same masks are applied to them.  This
means that you must use different category names for events that have
different number of fields.  For example, the numbers of fields must
be different for binary and unary rule applications, because they
should be represented with the different number of fields.

<p>
An unfiltered event represents a derivation forest for a sentence with
a feature forest format.  The model estimation requires derivation
forests for all sentences in a training data (i.e., derivbank), the
tool parses all sentences and outputs forests of probabilistic events
by extracting probabilistic events for each node in derivation
forests.  Hence, this tool requires the implementaiton of the
interfaces for parsing and for extracting probabilistic events from
derivations.

<p>
First, in order to parse sentences, you must implement the interfaces
defined in "UP" (such as id_schema_binary).  For details, see <a
href="usegrammar.html">"How to use a grammar"</a> and <a
href="up.html">the manual of UP</a>.

<p>
In addition, you must implement the following predicates defined in
"mayz/forestmake.lil", which substitute for
<tt>sentence_to_word_lattice/2</tt> and <tt>lexical_entry/2</tt>.

<p>
<table border=1>
<tr><td colspan=2><tt>fm_derivation_to_word_lattice(+$Derivation, -$WordLattice)</tt>
<tr><td>$Derivation<td>derivation
<tr><td>$WordLattice<td>word lattice (list of 'extent')
<tr><td colspan=2>Make a word lattice from a derivation.
</table>

<table border=1>
<tr><td colspan=2><tt>fm_lexical_entry(+$Lex, -$LexName)</tt>
<tr><td>$Lex<td>input word and the named of a template that will be assigned to the
word (lex_entry)
<tr><td>$LexName<td>LEX_NAME (the second argument of 'lexical_entry/2')
<tr><td colspan=2>Provide lexical entries that are assinged to a word.
</table>

<p>
The above predicates may be implemented like
"<tt>sentence_to_word_lattice/2</tt>" and "<tt>lexical_entry/2</tt>".
However, they provide us information that is necessary for the correct
derivation, and this information may be exploited.  For example, since
"<tt>fm_lexical_entry/2</tt>" gives the name of the correct lexical
entry, we can cut off lexical entries with low probabilities by
returning the correct lexical entry and other lexical entries with
high probabilities.  This technique greatly reduces the time for
parsing training sentences, and hence for making an event file.  Note
that correct lexical entries must be included in assigned lexical
entries because a derivation forest must include a correct derivation
tree.

<p>
The following predicte must also be implemented to make correct
derivation trees.  While derivations in a derivbank are used for
making correct derivation trees, the following predicate is necessary
for providing lexical entries corresponding to terminal nodes.

<p>
<table border=1>
<tr><td colspan=2><tt>fm_correct_lexical_entry(+$Term, -$LexName)</tt>
<tr><td>$Term<td>terminal node of a derivation (derivation_terminal)
<tr><td>$LexName<td>LEX_NAME (the second argument of lexical_entry/2)
<tr><td colspan=2>Returns the correct lexical entry corresponding to a
terminal node of a derivation.
</table>

<p>
Next, the following interfaces defined in "mayz/amismodel.lil" are
required for extracting probabilistic events.  They extract an event
from each node in a derivation forest.  An event is represented as a
list of strings.  "<tt>forestmaker</tt>" calls these predicates for
each node in a derivation forest, and the results are output into an
event file in a feature forest format.

<p>
<table border=1>
<tr><td colspan=2><tt>extract_terminal_event(+$ModelName, -$Category,
+$LexName, +$Sign, +$SignPlus, -$Event)</tt>
<tr><td>$ModelName<td>name of a probabilistic model
<tr><td>$Category<td>name of a category
<tr><td>$LexName<td>LEX_NAME (the second argument of "lexical_entry/2")
<tr><td>$Sign<td>lexical entry
<tr><td>$SignPlus<td>SIGN_PLUS (the third argument of "reduce_sign/3")
<tr><td>$Event<td>event (a list of strings)
<tr><td colspan=2>Extract an event of a terminal node.
</table>

<table border=1>
<tr><td colspan=2><tt>extract_unary_event(+$ModelName, -$Category,
+$SchemaName, +$Dtr, +$Mother, +$SignPlus, -$Event)</tt>
<tr><td>$ModelName<td>name of a probabilistic model
<tr><td>$Category<td>name of a category
<tr><td>$SchemaName<td>name of a schema
<tr><td>$Dtr<td>daughter sign
<tr><td>$Mother<td>mother sign
<tr><td>$SignPlus<td>SIGN_PLUS (the third argument of "reduce_sign/3")
<tr><td>$Event<td>event (a list of strings)
<tr><td colspan=2>Extract an event of a unary rule application.
</table>

<table border=1>
<tr><td colspan=2><tt>extract_binary_event(+$ModelName, -$Category,
+$SchemaName, +$LeftDtr, +$RightDtr, +$Mother, +$SignPlus, -$Event)</tt>
<tr><td>$ModelName<td>name of a probabilistic model
<tr><td>$Category<td>name of a category
<tr><td>$SchemaName<td>name of a schema
<tr><td>$LeftDtr<td>sign of a left daughter
<tr><td>$RightDtr<td>sign of a right daughter
<tr><td>$Mother<td>sign of a mother
<tr><td>$SignPlus<td>SIGN_PLUS (the third argument of "reduce_sign/3")
<tr><td>$Event<td>event (a list of strings)
<tr><td colspan=2>Extract an event of a binary rule application.
</table>

<table border=1>
<tr><td colspan=2><tt>extract_root_event(+$ModelName, -$Category, +$Sign, -$Event)</tt>
<tr><td>$ModelName<td>name of a probabilistic model
<tr><td>$Category<td>name of a category
<tr><td>$Sign<td>name of a schema
<tr><td>$Event<td>sign of a root node
<tr><td colspan=2>Extract an event of a root node.
</table>

<p>
The name of a probabilistic model must be the same as the first
command-line argument of "<tt>forestmaker</tt>".

<p>
For each interface, we also provide a version in which the value of a
feature function (integer or float) can be specified.  Add the feature
value as the last argument.

<ul>
  <li><tt>extract_terminal_event_feature_value/7</tt>
  <li><tt>extract_unary_event_feature_value/8</tt>
  <li><tt>extract_binary_event_feature_value/9</tt>
  <li><tt>extract_root_event_feature_value/5</tt>
</ul>

<p>
"<tt>forestmaker</tt>" allows for the development of an event file
with a reference distribution.  Specify the file name of a reference
distribution in the "-r" option, and implement the following
interfaces.

<p>
<table border=1>
<tr><td colspan=2><tt>reference_prob_terminal(+$ModelName, +$LexName,
+$Sign, +$SignPlus, -$Prob)</tt>
<tr><td>$ModelName<td>name of a probabilistic model
<tr><td>$LexName<td>LEX_NAME (the second argument of "lexical_entry/3")
<tr><td>$Sign<td>sign of a terminal node
<tr><td>$SignPlus<td>SIGN_PLUS (the third argument of "reduce_sign/3")
<tr><td>$Prob<td>reference probability of a terminal node
<tr><td colspan=2>Returns a reference probability of a terminal node.
</table>
