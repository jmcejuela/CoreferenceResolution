<h1>lexrefine: Tool for refining lexicon</h1>

<a href="lexrefine.ja.html">Japanese version</a>

<p>
This tool is for thresholding infrequent words and lexical entry
templates, and for expanding lexical entry templates by lexical rules.

<p>
<table border=1>
<tr><td colspan=2>lexrefine [options] rule_module orig_lexicon
    orig_template new_lexicon new_template
<tr><td>rule_module<td>lilfes program in which lexical rules are implemented
<tr><td>orig_lexicon<td>input lexicon
<tr><td>orig_template<td>input template database
<tr><td>new_lexicon<td>refined lexicon
<tr><td>new_template<td>refined template
<tr><td colspan=2>Options
<tr><td>-wf threshold<td>threshold of word frequency (default: 1)
<tr><td>-tf threshold<td>threshold of the frequency of lexical entry templates (default: 0)
<tr><td>-uwf threshold<td>threshold of the frequency of words to be
    regarded as unknown word (default: 1)
<tr><td>-utf threshold<td>threshold of the frequency of lexical entry
    templates to be adopted for unknown words (default: 0)
<tr><td>-v<td>print debug messages
<tr><td>-vv<td>print many debug messages
<tr><td>-vvv<td>print many many debug messages
</table>

<p>
"<tt>lexrefine</tt>" refines a lexicon and a template database with
the following operations.
<ul>
  <li>Remove lexical entry templates that are less frequent than a threshold.
  <li>Make derived lexical entry templates by applying lexical rules
  to lexemes.
  <li>Make lexicon entries for unknown words by regarding infrequent
  words in a lexicon as unknown words.
  <li>Remove words that are less frequent than a threshold from a lexicon.
  <li>Make lexicon entries for inflected words.
</ul>

<p>
First, remove lexical entry templates whose occurrence count is less
than the threshold (the value specified by "-tf" option).

<p>
Next, apply lexical rules to remaining templates, and make lexical
entry templtaes for inflected words.  Write lexical rules with the
following interfaces defined in "mayz/lexrefine.lil".
<table border=1>
<tr><td colspan=2><tt>expand_lexical_template(+$InTemplateName,
+$InTemplate, +$Freq, -$LexRules, -$NewTemplate)</tt>
<tr><td>$InTemplateName<td>name of an input template
<tr><td>$InTemplate<td>input lexical entry template
<tr><td>$Freq<td>occurrence count of the template
<tr><td>$LexRules<td>history of applied lexical rules
<tr><td>$NewTemplate<td>derived lexical entry template
<tr><td colspan=2>Apply lexical rules to a lexical entry template of a
    lexeme, and make a new lexical entry template.
</table>
A new lexical entry template is assigned the name (the pair of a
lexeme name and a history of lexical rules), and is stored in a
template database.  The frequency of a new template is regarded as
the same as the original template (lexeme).

<p>
To use derived lexical entry templates, implement the following
interface.
<table border=1>
<tr><td colspan=2><tt>expand_lexicon(+$InKey, +$TemplateName, -$NewKey)</tt>
<tr><td>$InKey<td>a key of an input word
<tr><td>$TemplateName<td>name of a template ('lex_template' type)
<tr><td>$NewKey<td>a new key
<tr><td colspan=2>From a key of a lexicon, $InKey, make a new key,
    $NewKey, to which the derived template should be assigned.  For
    example, when a template for passive is made from that for a base
    verb, we make a new key "loved/VBN" from "love/VB".
</table>

<p>
Next, for each entry in a lexicon, if the occurrence count of a word
(to be more precise, the key given by the third argument of
"<tt>reduce_lexical_template/5</tt>") is less than the threshold (the
value specified by "-wf" option), the entry is removed from the
lexicon.  The other entries remain in the lexicon, while the
templates deleted in the first step are automatically removed from
the entries.

<p>
In addition, a word is regarde as "unknown word" if its occurrence
count is less than the value of the "-uwf" option.  That is, templates
assigned to the word are added to the template list for an unknown
word.  The key of an unknown word is specified with
"<tt>unknown_word_key/2</tt>" defined in "mayz/lexrefine.lil".
<table border=1>
<tr><td colspan=2><tt>unknown_word_key(+$InKey, -$OutKey)</tt>
<tr><td>$InKey<td>key of an input word
<tr><td>$OutKey<td>key of an unknown word
<tr><td colspan=2>Make a key for an unknown word.
</table>
For example, if this predicate provides the POS of $InKey, a parser
will look up an unknown word entry with a POS.  You can additionally
specify the threshold of the occurrence count of templates to be
assigned to unknown word entries.
