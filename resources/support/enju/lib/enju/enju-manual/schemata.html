<h1>Schemata and principles</h1>

<a href="schemata.ja.html">Japanese version</a>

<p>
Schemata and principles are defined in the file "grammar/schema.lil"．The name of each schema is given in 
the file "grammar/types.lil"．

<p>
The following standard HPSG schemata are implemented．

<table border>
<tr><th>Schema<th>Name given to the schema in the definition file<th>Description
<tr><td>Head-Subject Schema<td>subj_head_schema<td>A verb takes a noun phrase as its subject
<tr><td>Head-Complement Schema<td>head_comp_schema<td>A verb or a preposition takes a noun phrase as its object
<tr><td>Head-Specifier Schema<td>spec_head_schema<td>A noun takes a determiner(an article or a demonstrative)
<tr><td>Head-Modifier Schema (left head)<td>head_mod_schema<td>The head is premodified by a modifier
<tr><td>Head-Modifier Schema (right head)<td>mod_head_schema<td>The head is postmodified by a modifier
<tr><td>Head-Filler Schema<td>filler_head_schema<td>Long distance dependencies
</table>

<p>
Besides the above schemata, we have added the following schemata．
<table border>
<tr><th>Name given to the schema in the definition file<th>Description
<tr><td>head_relative_schema<td>A noun is modified by a relative clause
<tr><td>coord_right_schema<td>A conjunction takes its right conjunct as its argument
<tr><td>coord_left_schema<td>A conjunction takes its left conjunct as its arugment
<tr><td>empty_filler_head_schema<td>A relative clause takes an empty relative pronoun as its argument
<tr><td>empty_specifier_schema<td>?A noun takes an empty specifier as its argument
</table>

<p>
The following principles are implemented．

<table border>
<tr><th>Name given to the schema in the definition file<th>Description
<tr><td>head_feature_principle<td>The HEAD value of the head daughter is passed up to its mother
<tr><td>semantic_binary_principle<td>?The CONT value of the head daughter is passed up to its mother. The CONT value of the non-head daughter is incorporated in the RELS list of its mother.非主辞の CONT
    は RELS に入る
<tr><td>semantic_unary_principle<td>The CONT value of the only daughter is passed up to its mother.
<tr><td>phonology_principle<td>The PHON value of all daughters are concatenated
<tr><td>adjacency_principle<td>The PROB_FEATURE|L_ADJAC feature contains information passed up from the left daughter whereas of PROP_FEATURE|R_ADJAC contains information passed up from the right daughter
</table>

<p>
Besides the able principles, we have principles for passing information used by the statistical model．

<p>
Other principles in HPSG(such as the Valence Principle) are hard-coded as part of the above principles.
