<h2><a name="overview">1. Overview</a></h2>

<p>
Enju outputs <em>phrase structures</em> and <em>predicate argument
structures</em> in an XML format.  Phrase structures are tree
structures that express how words are combined to form phrases and
clauses.  Predicate argument structures are a set of relations that
describe semantic relations of words/phrases/clauses in a sentence.

<p>
For example, a phrase structure of the sentence "John has come." is
described by the following tree structure:

<pre>
(S (NP John) (VP has (VP come)))
</pre>

where "S", "NP", and "VP" are syntactic categories of phrases.  In
phrase structures, internal nodes are syntactic categories, and
terminal nodes are words.

<p>
A predicate argument structure of the same sentence is given as the
following three relations.

<pre>
&lt; come, arg1, John &gt;
&lt; has, arg1, John &gt;
&lt; has, arg2, come &gt;
</pre>

<p>
Each tuple represents a labeled relation (a labeled dependency from a
word to a phrase/clause).  For example, the first tuple means that
"arg1" (the first argument, i.e., the semantic subject) of "come" is
"John".  The first element of a tuple expresses a predicate word, the
second element is a label of the relation, and the third element is an
argument phrase/clause of the predicate.  Because relations
represented by predicate argument structures are relations between a
predicate and its arguments in a predicate logic, they do not
necessarily correspond to syntactic head/argument.  For example, when
a prepositional phrase modifies a noun, the preposition is represented as
a predicate and the noun is denoted as the "arg1" of the preposition,
while, in syntax, the noun is the head and the prepositional phrase is
the non-head.

<p>
Enju represents both structures in XML with three tags as listed below.

<table border="1">
<tr><th>tag</th><th>attributes</th><th><br /></th></tr>
<tr><td>sentence</td><td>id parse_status fom</td><td>sentence</td></tr>
<tr><td>cons</td><td>id cat xcat schema head sem_head</td>
    <td>syntactic constituents (phrases, clauses, etc.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>tok</td><td>id cat pos base tense aspect voice aux type lexentry
pred arg1 arg2 arg3 arg4 mod</td>
    <td>words, punctuations</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
In general, "cons" represents phrase structures.  Unique identifiers
are assigned to every "cons" tag, and they are denoted by the "id"
attribute.  Syntactic categories of phrases and clauses, such as "NP"
and "S", are expressed by the "cat" attribute, and finer
classifications of categories are represented by the "xcat" attribute.
Syntactic/semantic head daughters of internal nodes are expressed by
the "head" and "sem_head" attributes, respectively.  These attributes
denote the identifier of "cons" of the head daughter.  Terminal nodes
of phrase structures are "tok" tags, and, like "cons", identifiers and
syntactic categories are represented by the "id" and "cat" attributes.
Additionally, Penn Treebank-style POS and a base form of a word are
described by the "pos" and "base" attributes.

<p>
Predicate argument structures are expressed by attributes of the "tok"
tag: "pred" denotes the type of the predicate for a word.
"arg1", ..., "arg4", and "mod" denote identifiers of "cons", and
they represent argument or modification phrases/clauses 
of the predicate.
For example, when  the value of "pred" is "verb_arg1" and 
the value of "arg1" is "c1", the first argument
(i.e., semantic subject) is a phrase or a clause which is assigned
the identifier "c1".

<p>
The other tag, "sentence", is used to express additional information
of parsing results.  A string processed by Enju as a sentence is
bracketed by "sentence", and is assigned an identifier (the "id"
attribute).  The "parse_status" attribute represents whether parsing
has succeeded or not.  This attribute has "success" when parsing
succeeded, and has a reason of the failure as listed below when
failed.

<table border="1">
<tr><th>parse_status</th><th>reason of failure</th></tr>
<tr><td>empty line</td><td>The input line is an empty string</td></tr>
<tr><td>fragmental parse</td><td>Although the parser could not produce an analysis 
that spans the whole sentence, it outputs fragmental parse results</td></tr>
<tr><td>no successful parse</td><td>The parser could not produce an
analysis</td></tr>
<tr><td>POS tagging error</td><td>Tokenization or POS tagging failed or
returned an ill-formed string</td></tr>
<tr><td>lexical entry assignment error</td><td>Assignment of lexical
entries failed (e.g. caused by wrong POS tags)</td></tr>
<tr><td>sentence length limit exceeded</td><td>The number of words was larger than
the limit (enlarge the limit of sentence length to parse those sentences)</td></tr>
<tr><td>edge number limit exceeded</td><td>The number of produced edges
exceeded the limit (enlarge the limit of edge number to parse those sentences)</td></tr>
<tr><td>parser setup error</td><td>Set-up of internal data structures
failed (e.g. failure of memory allocation)</td></tr>
<tr><td>XML encoding error</td><td>Something wrong happened when encoding
a parse result into an XML format (contact the developer when you find
this error)</td></tr>
<tr><td>unknown error</td><td>Error caused by an unknown reason
(contact the developer when you find this error)</td></tr>
<tr><td>fatal error</td><td>An unrecoverable error occurred (contact
the developer when you find this error)</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
The "fom" attribute denotes a figure-of-merit, which is a score of
goodness of the parsing result.

<p>
Here is an example XML-style output of the parsing of sentence "John
has come":

<pre>
&lt;sentence id="s0" parse_status="success" fom="7.28"&gt;
  &lt;cons id="c0" cat="S" xcat="" head="c3" sem_head="c3"&gt;
    &lt;cons id="c1" cat="NP" xcat="" head="c2" sem_head="c2"&gt;
      &lt;cons id="c2" cat="NX" xcat="" head="t0" sem_head="t0" &gt;
        &lt;tok id="t0" cat="N" pos="NNP" base="john" pred="noun_arg0"&gt;
          John
        &lt;/tok&gt;
      &lt;/cons&gt;
    &lt;/cons&gt;
    &lt;cons id="c3" cat="VP" xcat="" head="c4" sem_head="c5"&gt;
      &lt;cons id="c4" cat="VX" xcat="" head="t1" sem_head="t1"&gt;
        &lt;tok id="t1" cat="V" pos="VBZ" base="have" pred="aux_arg12" arg1="c1" arg2="c5"&gt;
          has
        &lt;/tok&gt;
      &lt;cons id="c5" cat="VP" xcat="" head="t2" sem_head="t2"&gt;
        &lt;tok id="t2" cat="V" pos="VBN" base="come" pred="verb_arg1" arg1="c1"&gt;
          come
        &lt;/tok&gt;
      &lt;/cons&gt;
    &lt;/cons&gt;
  &lt;/cons&gt;
&lt;/sentence&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Linguistic meanings of syntactic categories and predicate-argument
relations will be explained in Section 2 and 3.

<p>
Other linguistic features, such as applied schema, tense, and aspect,
 are output as attributes of the "cons" and "tok" tags, although
they are omitted from the example above.  These are explained in
Section 4.

<hr />

<h2><a name="ps">2. Phrase structures</a></h2>

<p>
Phrase structures are represented by two tags, "cons" and "tok":
"cons" expresses internal nodes, and "tok" denotes terminal nodes of
tree structures.  In general, "cons" corresponds to phrases and
clauses, which are called "constituents", while "tok" corresponds to
words and punctuations, which are called "tokens".  All "cons" and
"tok" tags are assigned unique identifiers, which will be used to
express various linguistic relations by identifying targets of the
relations.  Attributes of these tags represent syntactic information
of annotated constituents.

<p>
<table border="1">
<caption>Attributes of "cons"</caption>
<tr><td>id</td><td>identifier</td></tr>
<tr><td>cat</td><td>syntactic category</td></tr>
<tr><td>xcat</td><td>extra features of syntactic category</tr></tr>
<tr><td>head</td><td>ID of the syntactic head daughter</td></tr>
<tr><td>sem_head</td><td>ID of the semantic head daughter</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
<table border="1">
<caption>Attributes of "tok"</caption>
<tr><td>id</td><td>identifier</td></tr>
<tr><td>cat</td><td>syntactic category</td></tr>
<tr><td>pos</td><td>Penn Treebank-style part-of-speech tag</td></tr>
<tr><td>base</td><td>base form</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
A tree of syntactic constituents is expressed by nested "cons" tags.
In the output of Enju, all trees have only binary or unary branchings;
that is, each "cons" tag covers at most two "cons" tags in it.

<p>
Syntactic categories of constituents are expressed by the attribute,
"cat".  A value of "cat" is a concatenation of a POS (e.g., ADJ) and a
suffix which indicates whether a constituent is a saturated phrase
(expressed by "P") or an unsaturated constituent ("X").  A list of
POSs is given below.

<table border="1">
<tr><td>ADJ</td><td>Adjective</td></tr>
<tr><td>ADV</td><td>Adverb</td></tr>
<tr><td>CONJ</td><td>Coordination conjunction</td></tr>
<tr><td>C</td><td>Complementizer</td></tr>
<tr><td>D</td><td>Determiner</td></tr>
<tr><td>N</td><td>Noun</td></tr>
<tr><td>P</td><td>Preposition</td></tr>
<tr><td>SC</td><td>Subordination conjunction</td></tr>
<tr><td>V</td><td>Verb</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
Additional symbols express other types of constituents.  They are used
as values of "cat" without suffixes.

<table border="1">
<tr><td>COOD</td><td>Part of coordination</td></tr>
<tr><td>PN</td><td>Punctuation</td></tr>
<tr><td>PRT</td><td>Particle</td></tr>
<tr><td>S</td><td>Sentence</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
Syntactic categories of tokens are also specified as values of "cat"
of "tok" tags.  The values are the same as the above, while, in this
case, suffixes are not expressed.  Additional attributes, "pos" and
"base", represent morphological information: a Penn Treebank-style POS
tag and the base form of the input string.

<p>
For example, "cat" of "tok" of the word "John" is "N", because this
word is a noun.  The value of "pos" is "NNP", which means a singular
proper noun.  It also constitutes a nominal constituent without a
determiner, and therefore is assigned "NX" as a value of "cons".
Furthermore, since this constituent can take an empty determiner to
become a noun phrase, it is also assigned another "cons" tag with "NP"
as the value of "cat".

<p>
Since symbols of "cat" are sometimes very coarse, "xcat" expresses
important linguistic distinctions.  The value of "xcat" is a
space-separated set of the following values.

<table border="1">
<tr><td>COOD</td><td>Coordinated phrase/clause</td></tr>
<tr><td>IMP</td><td>Imperative sentence</td></tr>
<tr><td>INV</td><td>Subject-verb inversion</td></tr>
<tr><td>Q</td><td>Interrogative sentence with subject-verb inversion</td></tr>
<tr><td>REL</td><td>A relativizer included</td></tr>
<tr><td>FREL</td><td>A free relative included</td></tr>
<tr><td>TRACE</td><td>A trace included</td></tr>
<tr><td>WH</td><td>A wh-question word included</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
The value of "head" or "sem_head" is an identifier of one of its
daughters.  They indicate the identifier of the head daughter of the
phrase.

<p>
The syntactic head of a constituent is denoted by "head", and is a
daughter constituent that determines syntactic characteristics of the
constituent.  Usually, the syntactic head of "X phrase" (X=verb, noun,
adjective, etc.) is X.  The syntactic head of a sentence is a main
verb phrase.

<p>
The semantic head of a phrase is denoted by "sem_head", and is a
daughter constituent that mainly conveys a semantic content of the
constituent.  That is, function words are not semantic heads even when
they are syntactic heads, while content words are syntactic and semantic
heads.  Actually, in the current implementation of Enju, "head" and
"sem_head" are different in the following cases.
<ul>
  <li>Auxiliary construction (including to-infinitive): "head" is the
  auxiliary verb, while "sem_head" is the main verb (see the example
  in Section 1).
  <li>Complementizer phrase (that, whether, for): "head" is the
  complementizer, while "sem_head" is the clause.
  <li>Quotation: "head" is the quotation mark, while "sem_head" is the
  content of the quotation.
  <li>Passive "by" phrase: "head" is "by", while "sem_head" is the
  object of the "by" phrase.
  <li>Dative "to" phrase: "head" is "to", while "sem_head" is the
  object of the "to" phrase.
</ul>
In other cases, "head" is identical to "sem_head".

<h2><a name="pas">3. Predicate argument structures</a></h2>

<p>
Predicate argument structures are expressed by attributes of "tok":
"pred", "arg1", ..., "arg4", and "mod".  "pred" denotes the type of
a predicate.  The others denote identifiers of
constituents.  For example, when the value of "pred" is "verb_arg1" 
and the value of "arg1" is "c1", the
first argument (i.e., semantic subject) is a phrase or a clause
identified by "c1".

<p>
A value of "pred" is one of the following values.
It is a concatenation of a POS (e.g., noun, verb) and
a symbol (or symbols) which indicates required arguments.
<table border="1">
<tr><th>Attribute</th><th>Values</th><th><br /></th></tr>
<tr><td>pred</td><td>noun_arg0, noun_arg1, noun_arg2, 
noun_arg12, it_arg1, there_arg0, quote_arg2, quote_arg12,
quote_arg23, quote_arg123, poss_arg2, poss_arg12, 
aux_arg12, aux_mod_arg12, 
verb_arg1, verb_arg12, verb_arg123, verb_arg1234, 
verb_mod_arg1, verb_mod_arg12, verb_mod_arg123, verb_mod_arg1234, 
adj_arg1, adj_arg12, adj_mod_arg1, adj_mod_arg12, 
conj_arg1, conj_arg12, conj_arg123, 
coord_arg12, det_arg1, 
prep_arg12, prep_arg123, prep_mod_arg12, prep_mod_arg123, 
lgs_arg2, dtv_arg2, punct_arg1, app_arg12, 
lparen_arg123, rparen_arg0, 
comp_arg1, comp_arg12, comp_mod_arg1, relative_arg1, relative_arg12 
</td><td>predicate type</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
Argument numbers ("X" in "argX") are assigned in the order of surface
realizations in declarative sentences.  For nouns, verbs, adjectives,
adverbs, and prepositions, "arg1" is assigned to a left argument, and
"arg2", ..., "arg4" are assigned to right arguments in a left-to-right
order.  "mod" is assigned to a modifiee of VP modifiers (e.g. a matrix
clause of participial construction).  For complementizers and
determiners, their dependent phrases/clauses will be "arg1".  The
complement of "'s" (e.g. "John" in "John 's") is expressed as "arg2".
For punctuations, and particles, their dependent phrases are denoted
by "arg1".  For subordination/coordination conjunctions, main/left
conjuncts are represented by "arg1", and the other conjuncts are
expressed as "arg2".

<p>
For example, "A beautiful butterfly is coming into my room." has
following predicate argument relations.

<pre>
&lt; coming, arg1, A beautiful butterfly &gt;
&lt; is, arg1, A beautiful butterfly &gt;
&lt; is, arg2, coming into my room &gt;
&lt; beautiful, arg1, butterfly &gt;
&lt; a, arg1, beautiful butterfly &gt;
&lt; into, arg1, coming &gt;
&lt; into, arg2, my room &gt;
&lt; my, arg1, room &gt;
</pre>

<p>
In the XML format, each relation is expressed by an attribute of
"tok".  For example, when we suppose the identifier of the phrase "A
beautiful butterfly" is "c1", the XML annotation for "coming" will be
like this:

<pre>
&lt;tok id="t1" cat="V" pos="VBG" base="come" pred="verb_arg1" arg1="c1" &gt;
  coming
&lt;/tok&gt;
</pre>

<hr />

<h2><a name="others">4. HPSG-specific features</a></h2>

<p>
Because the grammar of Enju has rich linguistic information, a part of
it can be output additionally.  The following attributes are added
to "cons" or "tok" tags.

<p>
<table border="1">
<caption>Attributes for "cons"</caption>
<tr><th>Attribute</th><th>Values</th><th><br /></th></tr>
<tr><td>schema</td><td>subj_head, head_comp, spec_head, head_mod,
mod_head, filler_head, head_relative, coord_left, coord_right,
empty_filler_head, empty_spec_head, free_relative</td><td>applied schema</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
<table border="1">
<caption>Attributes for "tok"</caption>
<tr><td>tense</td><td>untensed, past, present</td><td>tense of a verb</td></tr>
<tr><td>aspect</td><td>none, perfect, progressive,
perfect-progressive</td><td>aspect of a verb</td></tr>
<tr><td>voice</td><td>active, passive</td><td>voice of a verb</td></tr>
<tr><td>aux</td><td>minus, modal, have, be, do,
copular</td><td>auxiliary verb or not</tr>
<tr><td>type</td><td>pred, noun_mod, verb_mod, adj_mod, prep_mod,
    other_mod, pred_mod</td><td>syntactic type</td></tr>
<tr><td>lexentry</td><td>(see below)</td><td>assigned lexical entry</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
All "cons" tags except preterminals (i.e., "cons" tags immediately
above "tok") have non-empty values for "schema".  All verbs have "aux"
attributes, while principal verbs (i.e., aux="minus" or aux="copular")
have "tense", "aspect", and "voice", whose values are non-empty
strings.  The "type" attribute expresses the syntactic type of a word:
"pred" means predicative, "noun_mod", "verb_mod", "adj_mod",
"prep_mod", and "other_mod" mean modifiers to
nouns/verbs/adjectives/prepositions/other words, respectively, and
"pred_mod" means a predicative modifier.  If no "type" is assigned, it
indicates that the word is an argument or the head of the sentence.

<p>
All "tok" tags have "lexentry".  A value of "lexentry" is a lexeme
name and applied lexical rules concatenated by hyphens.  For example,
when the value of "lexentry" is
"[NP.nom&lt;V.bse&gt;NP.acc]_lxm-singular3rd_verb_rule" the lexical
entry is obtained from the lexeme "[NP.nom&lt;V.bse&gt;NP.acc]_lxm" by
applying the rule "singular3rd_verb_rule".

<h2><a name="correspondence">5. Appendix: Correspondences between Enju and PTB</a></h2>

<p>
Here is a rough sketch of correspondences of syntactic categories of
Enju and Penn Treebank (PTB).  It should be noted that this table does
not necessarily mean that outputs of Enju can be formally translated
into PTB-style outputs.  Because the output of Enju is based on HPSG
and it is different from the annotation policy of PTB, tree structures
and/or syntactic categories are often different from those given by
the PTB-style annotation.  However, these mappings provide a clear
image of what Enju expresses.
