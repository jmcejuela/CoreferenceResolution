<h2><a name="sign">Structure of Sign</a></h2>

<p>
The grammar of Enju is based on the theory of Head-driven Phrase
Structure Grammar (HPSG).  In HPSG, constraints on the structure of a
language are represented with <em>typed feature structures</em>.
<a href="http://www-tsujii.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/lilfes">LiLFeS Home
Page</a> presents a brief introduction to typed feature structures.

<p>
One of the characteristics of HPSG is that most of the constraints on
syntax and semantics are represented in lexical entries, while only a
small number of grammar rules (corresponding to CFG rules) are defined
and they represent general constraints irrelevant to specific words.
This is because the constraints on the structure of a sentence are
mostly introduced by words.

<p>
Syntactic/semantic constraints of words/phrases are represented in the
data structure called <em>sign</em>.  In the current implementation of
Enju, the structure of the sign basically follows [Pollar and Sag,
1994] and <a href="http://www.delph-in.net/erg/">LinGO English
Resource Grammar (ERG)</a>, while the type hierarchy is much
simplified and modified not to use complex constraints nor Minimal
Recursion Semantics (MRS).

<p>
Constraints of phrases include various syntactic features
(part-of-speech, agreement, tense, etc.).

<p>
CONT feature has a predicate-argument structure of the phrase.
Predicate-argument structures represent relations of logical
subject/object and modifying relations.  The CONT feature of the sign
of the top node shows the predicate-argument structure of the whole
sentence.

<p>
Types and features used in the Enju grammar are all defined in
"enju/types.lil".  For details, see the source file.

<h2><a name="system">System architecture</a></h2>

<p>
The Enju system uses <em>UP</em> (included in the MAYZ package), a
general-purpose parser for unification grammars.  UP parses a sentence
with provided lexical entries and grammar rules.  Enju creates the
data passed to UP in the following way.

<p>
<img src="architecture.png" height=480 height=360 alt="Architecture of
the grammar">

<p>
An input sentence is passed to <tt>sentence_to_word_lattice/2</tt>,
and converted to a word lattice, i.e., a list of extents (a pair of
word position and word information).  A word lattice is passed to UP,
and parsing starts.  <tt>sentence_to_word_lattice/2</tt> first applies
a POS tagger to an input sentence (<tt>external_tagger/2</tt>), splits
it into words, and applies stemming to the words.
<tt>sentence_to_word_lattice/2</tt> is implemented in
"enju/grammar.lil".  By default, a POS tagger is "uptagger", and it
can be changed by "-t" option of "enju" (or by
<tt>initialize_external_tagger/2</tt>).

<p>
The predicate (<tt>lexical_entry/2</tt> and
<tt>lexical_entry_sign/2</tt>) makes lexical entries by using two
databases.  One is a mapping from a word/POS pair into a list of the
names of lexical entry templates assigned to the word
(<tt>lookup_lexicon/2</tt>).  The other is a mapping from the name of
a template into a feature structure of the template
(<tt>lookup_template/2</tt>).  Lexical entries are constructed by
adding word-specific information (e.g. PHON feature) to lexical entry
templates.  This predicate is implemented in "enju/grammar.lil".

<p>
Grammar rules (i.e., schemas) are implemented in "enju/schema.lil".
They define phrase structure rules to make a mother from its
daughters.

<p>
Inside UP, parsing proceeds in the following steps.
<ol>
<li> preprocessing
<li> lexicon lookup
<li> kernel parsing
</ol>
The preprocessor converts an input sentence into a word lattice
by <tt>sentence_to_word_lattice/2</tt>.  In the lexicon lookup,
the parser uses the predicate (<tt>lexical_entry/2</tt> and
<tt>lexical_entry_sign/2</tt>) to 
find lexical entries for the word lattice.  
Finally, the parser does phrase
analysis using the defined grammar rules in the kernel parsing process.
UP uses data structures called edge and chart for phrase analysis.

<h3><a name="edge">Edge</a></h3>

<p>
Edge is a quadruple &lt;
left-position, right-position, sign, FOM (Figure of Merit)&gt;, which
represents a phrasal structure for the sub-string of the target
sentence.  Left-position and right-position are positions in the
sentence.  Sign is a phrasal structure represented as a feature
structure.  That is, an edge is a phrase structures that corresponds
to a region.  The edge also has an
information about the score (FOM) for disambiguation of analysis.  

<h3><a name="chart">Chart</a></h3>

<p>
The parser has a data structure generally called `chart.'  The chart
is a two dimensional table.  Here, we call each cell in the table `CKY
cell.'  Let an input sentence s(= w1, w2, w3,...,wn), for example, w1
= "I", w2="saw", w3= "a", w4 = "girl", w5 = "with", w6 = "a", w7 =
"telescope" for the sentence "I saw a girl with a telescope", the
chart is arranged as follows.

<center>
<img src="up_chart.png" alt="chart">
</center>

Let S[i][j] be each cell in the chart.  The suffixes i and j
correspond to the left position and the right position in the
sentence.  For example, `edges' correspond to "I" are stored to
S[0][1], edges for "saw" are stored to S[1][2], and edges for
"telescope" are stored to S[6][7].
That is, the edges for word wi are stored to S[i-1][i].  The phrasal
edges generated during parsing are stored to the chart.  For example,
edges for "I saw" are stored to S[0][2], edges for "saw a" are stored
to S[1][3], and edges for wider phrase "I saw a" are stored to
S[0][3].  Supposing that the sentence length is n, edges for the whole
sentence are stored to S[0][n].  In the exmaple above, the edges for
the whole sentence are store to S[0][7].
During parsing, an edge (mother) is generated by applying the grammar
rules to two edges (daughters).  For example, the results of applying
the grammar rules to an edge in S[0][3] and an edge in S[3][5] are
stored to S[0][5].  

<h3><a name="fom">FOM</a></h3>

<p>
FOM of an edge represents how likely the edge is.
When a mother edge is generated by applying a grammar
rule, the FOM of the mother can be obtained
by adding the score of the rule.
Edges for the whole sentence region, which correspond to roots of
parse trees, must satisfy the root condition.
Of all the trees satisfying the condition, 
the one with the best FOM is taken as the final result.
