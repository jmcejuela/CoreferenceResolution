Enju is a syntactic analyzer for English. A grammar is based on
Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG), which is a linguistic
theory for syntax. Since this system computes more detailed structure
of sentences than CFG parsers, you can obtain various information such
as predicate-argument structures.

For example, Enju can parse the following sentence,

It's falling like a stone, said Danny Linger, a pit trader who was
standing outside the London International Financial Futures Exchange.

and you will get the results that the subject of "said" is "Danny
Linger" and the complement is "it's falling like a stone", and the
subject of "standing outside..." is "pit trader".

See "INSTALL" or the manual (enju-manual/index.html) for the
installation procedure.

How to run Enju:

1. Run "enju".
2. Input a sentence in a line.  Each line will be parsed and all
   predicate-argument relations in the sentence will be output.

For other formats for more detailed output (the XML and stand-off
formats), see the manual (enju-manual/index.html).
